Welcome to the dynamic side scroller made completely out of text!

Running Game:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

About the game:

You will be able to do all the things you can do in most side scrollers... But you have to figure out how to do them by using scrolls!
As you go, you will need to collect scrolls to learn more commands and features like how to move and use your inventory.
But thats not all, you need to find all the crystals in a level to beat it.
Beat all the levels and you win!
If you're feeling stuck you can always type ? to get the help you need to read your first scroll, save, return to the main menu, and exit.
Commands and item names are case sensitive so keep that in mind.
Most of all, enjoy the experience and have fun!

P.S. Don't question the jumping physics. It's very normal in ASCII World. DON'T QUESTION IT!
