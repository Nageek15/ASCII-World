Welcome to the dynamic side scroller made completely out of text!
Running the program is rather simple, double click on the compiled jar file and it should just start up!
As you go, you will need to collect scrolls to get more commands and features.
You will be able to do what you can in most side scrollers.
Some of these capabilities are jumping and walking!
But thats not all, there are items in the game that you are capabile of picking up!
Some may be necessary to progress through a level, but if you find a way without it, then congrats!
Most of all, enjoy the experience and have fun experienceing something semi-original!
